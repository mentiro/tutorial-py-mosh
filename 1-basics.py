###Variables
# name = "John Smith"
# age = 20
# is_new = True


###Input & Print
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# color = input("What is your favourite color " + name + "? ")
# print(name + " likes " + color)


###Type Conversion
# weight_lbs = input("What's your weight in Pounds? ")
# lbs2kg_ratio = 0.45359237 #1 pound = 0.45359237 kg
# weight_kg = int(weight_lbs) * lbs2kg_ratio
# print("You weight " + str('%.2f' % weight_kg) + " kg!")       #'%.2f' %  - limits to 2 decimal points


###Strings & formatted Strings
# car1="BMW"
# car2='Mercedes'
# car3="M2"
# other_cars='''
# volkswagen
# also audi
# and maybe subaru
# '''
# print(car1)
# print(car2[0])
# print(car3[-1])
# print(car2[0:4])    #returns the characters from 0 to 3
# print(car2[0:])     #returns the charactes to the end of the string
#
# first = "John"
# last = "Smith"
# msg1 = "My name is " + first + " " + last
# msg2 = f'My name is {first} {last}'     #formatted string - adding f and curly brackets
# print(msg1)
# print(msg2)


###String Methods
# planet = "Mars"
# location = "Solar system"
#
# print(len(planet))
#
# print(planet.upper())
# print(planet.lower())
# print(planet.find('M'))             #returns the index of the first occurance of M
# print(planet.replace('M','C'))      #replaces M with C
# print(planet.replace('m','C'))      #does nothing - shows this method is case sensitive
# print("system" in location)         #returns True - searches for the work "system" in the location Variable


###Arithmetic Operators & Function
# "The usual Operators"
# a = 5/3
# b = 5//3    #result is an int
# print(a)
# print(b)
# x = 5
# x += 2      #shorter version for x = x + 2
# print(x)
# #Functions
# y=3.14
# print(round(y))
# z=-33
# print(abs(z))       #prints the absolute (positive) value of the variable/number
#
# import math              #this imports the "math" module - now we can access various methods (functions) used for various calculations
# print(math.ceil(y))      #prints ceiling of the Variable
# print(math.floor(y))     #prints floor of the Variable
